# FizzBuzz

This is a simple project for a college course assignment.
It's based on the popular Fizzbuzz Code Interview, and it has several bugs and malfunctions on purpose.

The program should show:

- Fizz if the number of clicks is a multiple of 3
- Fuzz if is a multiple of 5
- FizzBuzz if is a multiple of 5 AND a multiple of 3
- And if its not any of the before cases, it should not show neither.

For running this you simply need to mount it on a server, like Live Server.
